	MVC, the design pattern.
	The main idea behind the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern
is to separate the presenatation from the business logic and user interaction.
	This means that each compoment is handled differintly and separate.
	
	* The Model, usually handles the information and data that the application
	  will work on. It is quite common for the models to use databases as
	  backends.

	* The View, render the user interface and present the data produced
	  by the Model.
	
	* The Controller, handles the Views and the Models.
	  Moreover in leaf framework, the Controller make system calls to the
	  core libraries.
	
Simple schematic:
	Models -> Views -> Controller
