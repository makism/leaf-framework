* You should keep in mind that most of the internal
  instances, have their first character uppercased.
  For example you use: $this->Db
  This is to minimize the possible of accidentally
  overlapping the core instances.

* Do not instantiate the core classes by yourself.
  This will result in errors and the framework`s
  behavior is unknown (but surely faulty).

* Don`t forget that when you load a Model, it is
  visible only in the Controller as a member
  property. Watch out for name collisions! ;)

* It is best to load any resources you need, like
  Models/Plugins/Libraries when you need them,
  and not massively in the Controller`s constructor
  (unless you need access to these resources in all
  methods).
