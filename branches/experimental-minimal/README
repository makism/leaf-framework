     * Supported PHP versions, 5.3 - or newer.
     
     * This is a exprerimental release, which means that, the API is not final,
       maybe change (although it is very unlikely to happen) and code
       clean ups will take place before merging to the TRUNK.
     
     * Also, this branch, serves as a port for PHP 5.3 for testing new features.
