Server Requirements.

	* PHP 5.1 (at least).
	
	* Mod-rewrite enabled.
	
	* XDebug (yup, for the time being -
	  used to generate some statistics).


Installation & Configuration in Three Steps.

	* Copy the whole framework in a subdirectory
	  under "htdocs", or in your personal "public_html".

	* Edit .htaccess and have "RewriteBase" to point to
	  your Url address, for example "/~username/".

	* Edit the general.php configuration file, located
	  under the leaf/etc/ directory.
	  The options that you should change at first are:
	  $general['hostname'] and $general['base_dir'].

That's it! leaf framework can now run and you can deploy
your very first web application.
If you point your browser to the Url in which the framework
will be run, you will see a welcome message and a sample
application.
Don't forget to check out the other configuration settings
for more advanced features.
