	* Object Orient Programming, at a glance.
	  When programming in object-oriented you describe your problems in
terms of objects and possible relations. This way you form inheritange
between your objects and define possible common behaviour.

	* Object Oriented Programming, in leaf framework.
	  Since leaf framework is completely object-oriented, you will have
to develop your applications in an object-oriented manner, that is your
Controller and the Models.
	  The classes "leaf_Controller" and "leaf_Model" inherit from "leaf_Base"
which provide unified access to framework's core libraries, and the user-defined
Models.
